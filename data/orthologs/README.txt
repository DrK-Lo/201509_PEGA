From Sam Yeaman:

The final tally was 47 genes after FDR correction, but alternatively you could take the genes with p < 0.05 (no FDR correction). I’ve attached the lists with these genes here (one for each direction). 

I’ve also attached the new list with the FDR-corrected significant gene names, which has 100 rows as some of the 47 genes were duplicated.

 I wanted to use a less restrictive list, can I use the “pvalue” column in the “pine orthologs” file
 
 you could also use the spruce orthologs, because this has genes that were pine top candidates with spruce orthologs that were significantly shifted. But you’d have to make sure to translate the pine-spruce orthology using the ortholog list.
